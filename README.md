## Abstract

It is widely known that MongoDB can suffer from performance issues when it has to process too much data.
This often leads to high CPU usage, memory spikes and overall degraded system performance, which leads to a poorer user experience.
By modifying certain MongoDB system settings, **and changing this**, **perhaps even this**, the major MongoDB performance problems can be eliminated (completely)
This results in a far more stable system environment, and will ultimately result in better response times system-wide.

## The problem

*What is the MongoDB performance problem? What other problems does it cause?*

## Why is it problem?

*Why is MongoDB performance issues a problem? Why does it remain as a problem, even though we encapsulated it? Why do we want to get rid of it?*

## Modifying the settings

*How does this change the MongoDB performance for the better? What issues are addressed here? Why does these modifications help us?*

## Result

*How does/doesn't the changes made work for us? Our system? Why might they work for the reader?*
