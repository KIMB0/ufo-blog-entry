# Abstract

It is widely known that MongoDB can suffer from performance issues when it has to process too much data.
This often leads to high CPU usage, memory spikes and overall degraded system performace, which leads to a poorer user experience.
By modifying certain MongoDB system settings, **and chaning this**, **perhaps even this**, the major MongoDB performance problems can be eliminated (completely)
This results in a far more stable system environment, and will ultimately result in better response times systemwide.
